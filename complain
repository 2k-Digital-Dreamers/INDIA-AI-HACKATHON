1)I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding a cyber incident that occurred on 22 Nov 2024. I have been subjected to unauthorized access to my personal data and financial information. The incident involved phishing emails which resulted in fraudulent transactions being made from my bank account.

Despite taking immediate action to secure my accounts and contacting my bank, the unauthorized transactions have caused significant financial loss and emotional distress. I request a thorough investigation into this matter and prompt action to mitigate any further damage.

Please provide me with updates on the status of this complaint and any steps being taken to resolve the issue.

Sincerely, digital dream
